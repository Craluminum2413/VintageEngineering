How to make your own machine using Vintage Engineering.

Create your project and make sure to add VintageEngineering DLL to the references (copy local = false)

Depending on how complex your machine is steps can vary, I'll cover the basics.

Most of my simple machines use block class VEElectricBlock. In JSON,  "class": "VEElectricBlock",

Your block must have the Electric block entity behavior installed on it. In order for the block to do anything with the power it receives, it must either have a custom block entity class or block entity behavior that interacts with the Electric behavior.

In your block entities you have access to many variables from the Electric behavior described above.
CurrentPower, MachineState, MaxPower, MaxPPS, are among the important ones.

Setting the defaults for a machine happens in JSON attributes.
Check any machine JSON attributes for examples, I'll cover the standard values below:

"craftinganimcode" : This is a built-in system I added for defining what code to use when animating during 'crafting'.
    Animation code is defined in the shape file, use the name as the code value to ensure no confusion.
    If using a crafting animation, be sure to add the entityBehavior "Animatable"

"entitytype" : This value defines what general purpose this machine has.
    "Consumer", "Producer", and "Relay" are the only values tested and working. Others will follow soon.

"maxpower": What is the max power this machine can hold? Power is stored as a ULong,
    meaning its max value is 18,446,744,073,709,551,615
    Do not use , in defining this value. "1024" is my standard value for this.

"maxpps": What is the Power Per Second rating of this machine? Meaning how much power is this
    machine capable of putting toward a recipe? Or if it's a generator, how much power can it produce per second at max efficiency?

The next section defines the WireNodes of the block, i.e. Which type of wires connect, and where they connect to this block.
"wireNodes": This is a very important tag that is used by the Catenary mod for wiring up the machine.
    "index": what is the index of this node? Starts at 0 for the first node.
    "wirefunction": The general function of this node, "Power" is the only one my mod currently supports.
        Other function types are possible, but currently untested or not fully implemented.
    "powertier": What tier of wire can connect to this block, currently only LV tier is functional.
    "maxconnections": How many connections does this node support?
    "xyz values": This defines the selection box of the node. It's what defines that little box you see when holding wire over the gold wire node of a machine.
        This uses the same type of system as the base games Collision and Selection boxes.
        Same with the rotateY values, which are used if you allow your machine to face different directions when placed using the "HorizontalOrientable" behavior.
        Again, see my machines as examples.
    Important, currently only single-node blocks are tested, multinode "Transformers" will be added and tested soon.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------- Client Server Stuff
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EVERYTHING that happens with machine simulation does so on the server only. The client does not simulate anything.
This is to ensure server security and minimize cheating. The clients are mearly updated on the status OF
a machine and needs to inform the server of machine inventory slot changes.

The Power and recipe crafting process should only ever happen server side.

Animations, rendering, and GUI Renderings are CLIENT only, so take those FromTreeAttributes updates seriously as that's
    usually the server telling you how the machine is doing.

All of my BlockEntity simualation ticks only happen on the server. The Electric Network update ticks only
    happen on the server.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Other important things:

MachineState has 4 options, On, Off, Sleeping, and Paused. There are important distinctions on how these should be used:
    On = A machine is Enabled and is actively crafting/processing/burning something. Animation (if set) is running.
    Off = A machine is Disabled, this stops the machine from doing anything including accepting/giving power.
    Sleeping = A machine is Enabled but NOT actively crafting/processing anything. Able to send/receive power.
    Paused = A machine is ON and Wants to craft, but is out of power or output is full.

A Sleepinng or Paused machine will tick at a slower rate to save update time!
    Override and use StateChange(EnumBEState) as a central function to manage the state and trigger/stop animations, particles, etc.

Ensure your ToTreeAttributes and FromTreeAttributes function call the base and are done well as the game uses these for
    saving the world as well as Client/Server syncing.

It is vital that your machine BE (Block Entity) override CanReceivePower and CanExtractPower and set them appropriately.

Override GetMachineHUDText in your block entity to add information to the popup data you see when looking at your machine.
    Be sure to call base to get power information first.

You do NOT need to do anything with the Electric Network power, all that is handled for you by the Electric behavior.

Please, Be kind, this framework took 9 months to build. So don't copy it. As I add features to my mod, hopefully it
    opens more opportunities for others to build upon it.
